# What is Reactive Enhancements?

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

```javascript
// Safe effect that won't crash your app
const dispose = safeEffect(() => {
  Elements.output.update({ textContent: state.count });
});

// Async effect with automatic cancellation
const stop = asyncEffect(async (signal) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/data?q=${state.query}`, { signal });
  const data = await response.json();
  Elements.results.update({ textContent: JSON.stringify(data) });
});

// Enhanced async state with race condition prevention
const users = asyncState(null);
await users.$execute(async (signal) => {
  const res = await fetch('/api/users', { signal });
  return res.json();
});
console.log(users.data);     // [...users]
console.log(users.isSuccess); // true
```

## What is Reactive Enhancements?

**Reactive Enhancements** is a production-hardening module for the DOMHelpers reactive system. It adds six categories of improvements on top of the core reactive library:

1. **Enhanced Batching** — Priority-based update queue with infinite loop detection
2. **Deep Reactivity for Collections** — Reactive `Map` and `Set` support
3. **Enhanced Computed Properties** — Smart caching with circular dependency detection
4. **Error Boundaries** — Isolated error handling so one bad effect doesn't crash everything
5. **Async Support** — Async effects with `AbortSignal` and race-condition-safe async state
6. **DevTools** — State inspection, change history, and debugging tools

Simply put, these are the features that take the reactive system from "works in development" to "reliable in production."

## Why Does This Exist?

### The Challenges in Production Reactive Systems

As reactive apps grow, you encounter problems that the core reactive library wasn't designed to handle:

```
Production Challenges:
│
├── Batching issues
│   └── Multiple effects for the same state run in unpredictable order
│
├── Collection limitations
│   └── Map and Set mutations don't trigger reactive effects
│
├── Computed inefficiency
│   └── Computed properties recalculate even when nothing changed
│   └── Circular computed properties cause infinite loops
│
├── Error fragility
│   └── One effect throwing an error can stop other effects
│
├── Async complexity
│   └── Fetching data creates race conditions
│   └── Previous requests aren't cancelled when new ones start
│
└── Debugging difficulty
    └── Hard to see what state changed and why
```

### What Enhancements Add

```
After enhancements load:
│
├── Priority queue
│   └── Computed → Watchers → Effects (guaranteed order)
│   └── Infinite loop detection (max 100 flushes)
│
├── Reactive Map and Set
│   └── map.set(), set.add() trigger reactive effects
│
├── Smart computed
│   └── Caches results, only recalculates when dirty
│   └── Throws clear error on circular dependencies
│
├── Error boundaries
│   └── Effects wrapped in try/catch with retry support
│   └── One effect failing doesn't affect others
│
├── Async effects
│   └── AbortController integration for automatic cancellation
│   └── Race condition prevention via request ID tracking
│
└── DevTools
    └── Track states, log changes, inspect history
    └── Auto-enabled on localhost
```

## Mental Model

Think of the enhancements module as a **building inspection and upgrade** for your reactive system.

The core reactive library is the house — it has walls, a roof, and plumbing (state, effects, watchers). The enhancements module is the inspector who comes in and:

- Adds a **priority mail system** so important updates arrive first (batching)
- Installs **smart meters** on the water and electricity (Map/Set reactivity)
- Puts **circuit breakers** in the electrical panel so one short doesn't take out the whole house (error boundaries)
- Adds **automatic shutoff valves** for when things go wrong (async cancellation)
- Installs **security cameras** so you can see what's happening (DevTools)

The house still works the same way — but now it's production-ready.

## What Changes When This Module Loads?

### Transparent patches (existing code works, no API changes)

| Feature | What changes |
|---------|-------------|
| `state()` | Now wraps Map/Set properties in reactive proxies |
| `computed(state, { key: fn })` | Now caches results and detects circular dependencies |

### New functions added to ReactiveUtils

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `safeEffect(fn, opts)` | Effect with error boundary and retry |
| `safeWatch(state, key, fn, opts)` | Watcher with error boundary |
| `asyncEffect(fn, opts)` | Async effect with AbortSignal |
| `asyncState(initial, opts)` | Async state with race prevention |
| `ReactiveUtils.ErrorBoundary` | Error boundary class |
| `ReactiveUtils.DevTools` | Development tools |

### New global

```javascript
ReactiveEnhancements          // The full API object
ReactiveEnhancements.batch    // Enhanced batch
ReactiveEnhancements.queueUpdate  // Priority queue function
ReactiveEnhancements.safeEffect   // Safe effect
ReactiveEnhancements.safeWatch    // Safe watcher
ReactiveEnhancements.asyncEffect  // Async effect
ReactiveEnhancements.asyncState   // Async state
ReactiveEnhancements.ErrorBoundary // Error boundary class
ReactiveEnhancements.DevTools     // DevTools
ReactiveEnhancements.PRIORITY     // Priority constants
```

## Big Picture: How Enhancements Fit In

```
DOMHelpers Reactive System (load order)
│
├── reactive module               → Core state, effects, computed, watchers
├── 02_dh-reactive-array-patch    → Array mutation reactivity
├── 03_dh-reactive-collections    → Collection CRUD
├── 04_dh-reactive-form           → Form state management
├── 05_dh-reactive-cleanup        → Lifecycle & disposal
├── 06_dh-reactive-enhancements   → Production hardening ← YOU ARE HERE
```

The enhancements module loads last and patches everything above. It depends on the reactive core (`01`) and benefits from the cleanup system (`05`).

## The Six Parts at a Glance

│   ├── queueMicrotask-based flush
│   └── Infinite loop detection (100 flush max)
│
├── PART 2: Deep Reactivity for Collections
│   ├── createReactiveMap() — Proxy wrapper for Map
│   ├── createReactiveSet() — Proxy wrapper for Set
│   └── Auto-applied when state() detects Map/Set properties
│
├── PART 3: Enhanced Computed Properties

    └── Auto-enabled on localhost
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Enhancements are production-hardening** — they make the reactive system more robust, not more complex
2. **Transparent patches** — existing code works without changes
3. **Six categories**: batching, collections, computed, errors, async, devtools
4. **Priority queue** ensures computed properties update before effects
5. **Error boundaries** prevent one bad effect from crashing others
6. **Async support** handles cancellation and race conditions automatically
7. **DevTools** auto-enable on localhost for easy debugging
